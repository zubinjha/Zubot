# Memory

`memory/` is for session history and longer-term memory artifacts.

Direction:
- allow day-based logs (for example `memory/daily/`)
- support future memory retrieval and summarization workflows
- avoid committing personal or sensitive data

Repository rule:
- keep only `memory/README.md` tracked unless explicitly needed.
